# About

*steelas* is a Python package developed to support research and design of Australian steel structures. It can be used to determine the section properties, materials properties, and design capacities for structural members as per Australian Standard AS4100:2020 (Steel Structures). 

*steelas* is developed by [Yuyu Wang](https://github.com/wyy0990), [Joe Gattas](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/9443),  and research collaborators at the [University of Queensland](https://civil.uq.edu.au/).
