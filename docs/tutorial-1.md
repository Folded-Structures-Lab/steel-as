# Quick Start

Python code for the following examples are available in the Github repository [examples folder](https://github.com/Folded-Structures-Lab/steel-as/tree/main/examples/tutorial_1.py). 

*steelas* can be used to determine the material properties, section properties, and design capacities for structural members as per Australian Standard AS4100:2020 (Steel Structures).

A typical operation is shown in the below example. Section and material properties are first defined from library import. A structural member is then defined from section, material, and design information. See the following pages for additional information. 

```
from steelas.member.geometry import SectionGeometry
from steelas.data.io import import_section_library


#create section and materials


# create a structural member


```
